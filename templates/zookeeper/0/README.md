# Apache Zookeeper (Experimental)


### Info:

 This template creates a multinode Zookeeper cluster on top of Rancher. The configuration is generated from Rancher metadata. Cluster size is fixed after deployment. A node can not be added without losing quorem, also restarting will require clients to update connection strings. 
 
 
### Usage:

 Select Apache Zookeeper from catalog. 
 
 Enter in the number of nodes for the cluster. This should be an odd number.
 
 Click deploy.
 
 Zookeeper can now be accessed over the Rancher network.
